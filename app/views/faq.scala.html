                            Q: Won’t separating players by state make the end results of the tournament biased?
                            <br>
                            A: No. Pools are already seeded by player skill. With each player in a pool being ranked 1 - n before hand. You are able to freely swap players between pools as long as you only have one of each rank in a pool. By doing this our system maintains the fairness of the tournament while allowing the TO to optimize the pools.

                            Q: What if the algorithm doesn’t work? Will there be enough of a project besides the algorithm?
                            <br>
                            A: We already have an algorithm worked out and sample code written that proves the concept. Even without the algorithm, the product is feature rich and useful. There is a need for a tool that helps set up and manage a round-robin tournament, and this is that solution.
